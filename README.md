A project leveraging CNNs and multiple machine learning models (Decision Trees, Random Forrest, and XGBoost) to detect pediatric pneumonia from X-ray images, achieving 99.83% AUC. Built a healthcare cost matrix to estimate the financial impact of model predictions, projecting $17M in potential annual savings.
